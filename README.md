Studies on whether word meanings are combined into sentence meanings under Continuous Flash Suppression. Experiments are based on Sklar et al. (2012). Reading and doing arithmetic nonconsciously. PNAS

## Experiment 1
Experiment 1a replicates Experiment 1 of Sklar et al (2012), but with English stimuli. That experiment demonstrated lower suppression times for sentence with semantically unusual meanings. Experiment 1b is an extension in which we compare sentences to their reverse (e.g., Tom whisked the cream, The cream whisked Tom), in order to better control lexical statistics.

## Experiment 2
Experiment 2a replicates Expriment 4 of Sklar et al (2012), but with English stimuli. That experiment demonstrated that phrases with negative emotional meanings (concentration camp) break suppression faster than phrases with neutral meanings. Experiment 2b is an extension in which we compare sentences to their reverse (the baby hit the brick, the brick hit the baby). Experiment 2c is a replication of Sklar et al.'s original Hebrew experiment, to test whether visual properties of Hebrew influence participants suppression times.
